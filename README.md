## Background

The anonymous counseling chat project has been developed and open-sourced by NETlinQ and Klean as a secure and anonymous web-based chat solution.

It can be deployed for many purposes, but was originally developed to be used by a publicly funded teenage counselling hotline.

Contributions and enhancements are very welcome.
